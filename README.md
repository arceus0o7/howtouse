## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The Anime Stock Market is a fun and engaging way to predict the future performance of anime series based on their user ratings. You can invest in your favorite anime and potentially profit by accurately predicting whether the anime's rating will go up or down within a specified time frame. Here's how it works:

## 2. Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with the Anime Stock Market, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on the Anime Stock Market platform.

2. **Funding Your Account**: Deposit an initial amount of funds into your account. This is the money you will use to invest in anime.

3. **Explore Anime**: Browse through the list of available anime series. You can choose from a wide range of titles.

## 3. Making Predictions<a name="making-predictions"></a>

Once you've explored the available anime, it's time to make your predictions. You have two options: **Buying High** and **Buying Low**.

### a. Buying High<a name="buying-high"></a>

If you believe that a particular anime's rating will increase, you can choose the "Buying High" option. Here's how to do it:

1. **Select the Anime**: Choose the anime you want to invest in.

2. **Specify Your Prediction**: Enter the target rating you believe the anime will achieve. For example, if the anime's current rating is 7.50, you might predict it will reach 7.55.

3. **Set a Limit (Optional)**: You can set a limit to control your potential losses. If the anime's rating drops below a certain point during the chosen duration, your losses will be limited to that point.

4. **Choose a Duration**: Decide the duration of your prediction. You can choose from options like "Intraday," "15 Days," "1 Month," or "3 Months."

### b. Buying Low<a name="buying-low"></a>

If you believe that a particular anime's rating will decrease, you can choose the "Buying Low" option. Here's how to do it:

1. **Select the Anime**: Choose the anime you want to invest in.

2. **Specify Your Prediction**: Enter the target rating you believe the anime will drop to. For example, if the anime's current rating is 7.50, you might predict it will decrease to 7.45.

3. **Set a Limit (Optional)**: You can set a limit to control your potential losses. If the anime's rating goes above a certain point during the chosen duration, your losses will be limited to that point.

4. **Choose a Duration**: Decide the duration of your prediction, just like with "Buying High."

## 4. Understanding Options<a name="understanding-options"></a>

The Anime Stock Market offers different time frames for your predictions. Here's what they mean:

### a. Intraday<a name="intraday"></a>

This option allows you to make predictions within the same day. You'll need to specify whether you believe the anime's rating will go up or down by the end of the day.

### b. 15 Days<a name="15-days"></a>

With this option, your prediction window is 15 days. You can choose to predict either an increase or decrease in the anime's rating within this period.

### c. 1 Month<a name="1-month"></a>

Predictions made for one month involve speculating on the anime's rating change over the course of a month.

### d. 3 Months<a name="3-months"></a>

If you prefer longer-term predictions, you can choose the 3-month option. This gives you more time to observe the anime's rating fluctuations.

## 5. Setting Limits<a name="setting-limits"></a>

Setting a limit is optional but can be useful to control your potential losses. You can specify a limit price that acts as a safety net. If the anime's rating goes beyond this limit during your chosen duration, your losses will be limited to that point.

## 6. Calculating Profits and Losses<a name="calculating-profits-and-losses"></a>

At the end of your chosen duration, the Anime Stock Market platform will calculate your profits or losses based on whether your prediction was correct. If the anime's rating reaches or surpasses your target rating, you'll make a profit. If it doesn't, you may incur a loss, which will be limited if you set a limit.

## 7. Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

The Anime Stock Market is a unique and entertaining way to engage with your favorite anime while potentially earning profits based on your predictions. Remember to research your chosen anime and make informed decisions to maximize your success in the market. Have fun and happy trading!
